➡️➡️➡️ alert("hello  there") ⬇️⬇️⬇️

In Node.js, the alert function is not defined 
because it's a part of the browser's Window interface. 
The alert function is used in web browsers to display a dialog box with a specified message and an OK button,
but Node.js runs in a server-side environment, which does not have a graphical user interface (GUI) or a windowing system.
